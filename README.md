# sp-project-work

Information about the project work (max. 18 points)  
  
Minimum requirement for the project work (max. 8 points):  
The project must be a Scientific Programming (SP) project, i.e., based on the content of the SP module.  
The project must integrate several topics presented in the module, at a minimum these are the following:  
- (1) Collection of real-world data  
- (2) Data preparation (e.g. strings to numerical using regular expressions)  
- (3) Use of Python built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples) and pandas data frames  
- (4) Use of conditional statements, loop control statements and loops  
- (5) Use of procedural programming or object-oriented programming (one of these or both)  
- (6) Use of tables, vizualizations/graphics for data exploration  
- (7) Integration of a statistical analyses (e.g. correlation analysis, statistical tests)  
- (8) Making the data, Python code, Jupyter notebooks, etc. available on Moodle  

Additional points for the project work if the following is met (max 6 points):  
- (1) Creativity of implementation (creative is everything which was not part of the lessons and exercises)  
- (2) Use of a Web API to collect data (must be part of the Python programming code)  
- (3) Use of a database (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL) and SQL-queries (must be part of the Python programming code)  
- (4) Use of Docker or a cloud service (e.g. Amazon EC2, Amazon Sagemaker, Azure Machine Learning studio)  
- (5) Creation of a simple web application to present data and analysis results  
- (6) Making the Python code/Jupyter notebooks publicly available in a GitHub repo (exclude large data sets using gitignore)  
  
The project presentation must be in the form of a video recording (max. 4 points)  
The following will be evaluated:  
- (1) Content of the presentation  
- (2) Structure of the presentation  
- (3) Quality of the presentation  
- (4) Time keeping: Length of the presentation in minutes = number of students per group x 5 minutes  
  
To be submitted as .zip file with the group number, e.g. projectwork_SP_FS2023_group_02.zip  
- 1.) Video recording of presentation as mp4 file, e.g. videopresentation_group_02.mp4
- 2.) Presentation as PDF file (as e.g. presentation_group_02.pdf) with the following minimal structure:
     - Title and full name of each student
     - Introduction (background, problem, objective, research question)
     - Materials and methods
     - Results & Discussion
     - Conclusions
     - IMPORTANT!!! In the appendix of the presentation, include what you think you did to earn the points.
                    Use screenshots and code-snippets to clearly demonstrate this.
                    The final evaluation will be made by the lecturer, not solely based on your listing.
